# Car Insurance Sales Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict the sale of car insurance. The models are built upon exploring various variables, such as Gender, Previously_Insured, Vehicle_Age, and Vehicle_Damage, which have been identified to make significant contributions to the prediction of responses.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to create an ideal model for a car insurance company that can efficiently predict the likelihood of a person buying their insurance based on the provided variables. By using this predictive model, the company can streamline its operations by eliminating unnecessary follow-ups and sales pursuits for individuals who are less likely to purchase insurance. This will result in saving both time and resources, which can then be focused on potential clients who are more likely to become actual customers in the future.

## How to Use the Jupyter Notebook

1. Clone the repository: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:



```bash
git clone https://github.com/jh991205/Insurance-Prediction
```


2. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system along with the necessary libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the repository directory, and run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the Notebook: In your web browser, the Jupyter Notebook dashboard should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8888`. Navigate to the `car_insurance_prediction.ipynb` file and open it.

5. Execute the Notebook: Run each cell in the Notebook sequentially to explore the data, preprocess it, train the Logistic Regression and KNN models, and evaluate their performance on the car insurance sales prediction task.

## Conclusion

The results of this analysis are crucial for the insurance company as it helps in effectively categorizing their potential customers. By understanding the relationship between each variable (Gender, Previously_Insured, Vehicle_Age, and Vehicle_Damage) and the final response (purchase of car insurance), the company can make data-driven decisions and optimize its sales efforts. Additionally, the insights from this project can provide readers with a general understanding of the factors influencing car insurance sales.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook and adapt the models for further improvements or to use them in your own projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
