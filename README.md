# Insurance-Prediction

A logistic model and a knn model is used to predict the sale of a car insurance. Upon exploration, variables Gender, Previously_Insured, Vehicle_Age and Vehicle_Damage put significant contributions to the prediction of responses. The purpose of choosing this topic is to create an ideal model where the company inserts one's information (varaibles as mentioned above), and will be given a prediction of the likliness of that person buying their insurance. This enables the company to eliminate unnecessary follow-ups and sales pursuing those who are less likely to buy insurance, and thus saves both time and resources for actual future clients. The result is important because it not only helps the unsurance company categorize their customers, but also gives its readers a general sense of the relationship between each variable and final response in terms of car insurances.
